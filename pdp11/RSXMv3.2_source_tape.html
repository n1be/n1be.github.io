  <h1>Discovering the RSX-11M v3.2 Sources</h1>

  <h2>Source files in the RSX Distribution Kit</h2>
  <p>
  After doing an <a href="RSXM32_Redux.html">RSX-11M V3.2 SYSGEN</a> there
  are sources for several system components available.  Exploring the media
  one can find the following.</p>
  <table cellpadding=5><caption><em>Source code from the RSX distribution kit</em></caption><td><pre>
[2,300] -   UETP
[11,10] -   Executive &amp; Drivers
[11,42] -   FORRES.MAC (This is from the Fortran-4 kit)
[12,10] -   MCR, IND, MCR Functions
[14,10] -   RMDemo
[15,10] -   PMD privileged tasks
[45,10] -   laboratory I/O ?
[200,200] - FCSRES.MAC
</pre></td></table>

  <h2>Sources for the privileged and unprivileged tasks</h2>
  <p>
  There are many utility programs provided in the RSX distribution kit.  Until
  now I had not found the sources.  Fortunately I saw
  <a href="ftp://ftp.trailing-edge.com/pub/rsxsource/rsxv32src.zip">
  rsxv32src.zip</a> on ftp.trailing-edge.com.  The zip file contains a 10.9 MB
  virtual tape in TPC format.  First one must extract the only file within the
  zip archive, rsxv32src.tpc.  Simh can directly access the TPC tape format.
  I used this initialization command.</p>
  <table cellpadding=5><caption><em>Attaching rsxv32src.tpc</em></caption><td><pre>
; Sources tape is mounted read-only on MM2:
attach -f -r tu2 TPC  rsxv32src.tpc
</pre></td></table>

  <p>
  By a process of trial and error the tape was found to be a BRU backup.  There
  was too much data on the tape to fit on an RL02.  Therefore all the files were
  restored to an RK07 for easier examination. These commands were used to copy
  the sources to the disk.</p>

  <p>
  It seems like sources are provided for everything that comes with RSX-11M V3.2
  except for the EDT text editor.  All these files were dated 25-Feb-81; almost
  two years after the release of RSX-11M V3.2.  I do not know if that means that
  the sources were updated to account for fixes provided by autopatch.</p>
