  <h1 id="Redux">Correcting a RSX-11M v3.2 System Crash</h1>
  <p>
  After <a href="RSXM32_Redux.html">a recent SYSGEN</a> there is a crash of the
  executive when accessing an RK05 disk.  This requires a reboot and on a
  multi-user system the work of other users could easily get lost.  (To avoid
  lossage, during the 1970's we got in the habit of saving our editor buffers
  every 10 minutes).</p>


  <h2 id="Symptoms">Obvious Symptoms of the Problem</h2>
  <p>
  The executive traps into XDT when a known good RK05 disk (device DK) is being
  accessed.
  This problem was easy to reproduce.  When it occurs there is a prompt at the
  console from XDT.  I/O from other devices and all processing stop:</p>

  <h3 id="Anal1">Initial analysis</h3>
  <p>
  This was not a problem on a recently generated RSX-11M V3.2 system.  What
  changed between then and when the problem occurred?<ul>
    <li>Both systems included the DB, DK, DL drivers.</li>
    <li>Both systems are for the same RSX-11M version</li>
    <li>The install kit was updated by autopatch "E" before the failing
	SYSGEN.</li>
    <li>The configuration was changed to add more devices before the failing
	SYSGEN.</li>
    <li>"Hardware" that RSX is running on has not been changed; no change to Simh, Raspbian,
	the Raspberry Pi, or the uSDHC card.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
  RL01/2 and RP06 (devices DL and DB) disks work without any problem.
  Therefore I do not suspect F11ACP or the executive.  This problem seems
  to be local to the DK driver.</p>
  <p>
  Initially I suspected that applying autopatch "E" introduced an issue.  But
  inspection showed that the driver source, DKDRV.MAC, was not patched.  And
  examination of DKDRV.MAC seems to indicate that this driver is unchanged since
  RSX-11M V3.1.  This suggessts stable and well tested code.</p>

  <h3 id="Refs">Reference Materials</h3>
  <p>
  A few references are needed to understand the problem at a deeper level.  These
  documents from bitsavers were handy:<br />
  &nbsp;* PDP-11 Programming Card (Prog), <br />
  &nbsp;* PDP-11/70 Processor Handbook (Proc),<br />
  &nbsp;* RSX-11M V3.2 Guide to Writing an I/O Driver (Guide),<br />
  &nbsp;* IAS/RSX-11 ODT Reference Manual (ODT),
  </p>
  <p>
  Since XDT has control of the system, let's use XDT to
  examine memory and hardware state.  (Guide section 3.4: XDT is a subset of ODT).
  </p>
  <p>
  My crash analysis technique is to quickly gather some info that almost always
  is needed.  With that context I dig deeper.  I will show a transcript of the
  XDT interaction.  While using XDT, a &lt;Line-Feed> character (Ctrl-J) can be typed
  to examine the next location.  References to various info will be flagged by
  ">>>&nbsp;some&nbsp;text".  Where ">>>" appears, the >>> and everything that
  follows on that line are my comments, not part of the XDT interaction.</p>

  Print out when the crash occurs is "<strong>OD:120334</strong>". (ODT section
  5.2: "OD" indicates an odd address or other trap 4; 120334 is the address of
  the instruction after the one where the trap occurred.)  (Prog: Trap 4 is due
  to Time Out and other errors.)</p>
  <p>
  As expected PSW shows the CPU is executing code in kernel mode (Prog).</p>
  <p>
  R2 contains the address of the first RK11 device register
  (Prog.).  This is unusual.  Typically PDP-11 device registers are referenced
  relative to the address of the Control and Status Register (or CSR) address.
  For the first RK11 controller in a system, the CSR address is 177404.</p>
  <p>
  Several words of code are examined before and after the PC of the failure.
  Using (Prog) they are disassembled by hand.  Working forward from 120334 is
  easy.  When working backwards, words at 120332 and 120326 are impossible or
  unlikely to instructions, so try again with the previous word.</p>
  <p>
  To properly interpret addresses, we need to understand how RSX-11M has
  allocated memory.  The lowest memory addresses, 000000 through 117777, 
  (the first 20 KW) are used by
  trap and interrupt vectors, the kernel mode stack, the executive code and
  the pool (dynamic storage region).  The PAR command shows how the remainder
  of memory is used.  This command was executed just before the crash, but
  since partitions do not move it could also be done later when analyzing.</p>

  (Proc section 5.3, Processor Traps) Trap to vector 4 occurs for Odd Address,
  UNIBUS Time Out, or Non-Existent Memory.    Because this is a mapped system,
  memory management state is needed to know what address is being accessed
  by the failing instruction at 120330.  (Proc chapter 6) explains the PDP-11/70
  memory management.</p>

  (Proc chapter 6):  MMR3 shows that 22-bit addresses are in use.  MMR3 also
  indicates that Data Space is not being used.  Since the PSW shows current
  mode is kernel, the kernel mapping registers are being used for address
  translation.  Kernel APRs map as follows.<br />
  &nbsp;* APR0 through APR4 map low memory (the executive).<br />
  &nbsp;* APR5 maps the DK driver and whatever immediately follows in memory.<br />
  &nbsp;* APR6 maps the address space of some task in the GEN partition.<br />
  &nbsp;* APR 7 maps the I/O Page.</p>
  <p>
  <strong>ADDRESS TRANSLATION</strong> per (Proc chapter 6):<br />
  &nbsp;* XDT used the same APR5 when examining the code as was in use when
  the trap occurred.  This assures that the failing instruction at virtual
  address 120330 is the "tstb -4(r2)" previously identified.<br />
  &nbsp;* The byte being tested is at virtual address (contents of R2) -4 =
  177400 - 4 = 177374(8),<br />
  &nbsp;* Virtual address 177374 maps through APR7 to physical adddress (PA) 17777374.<br />
  &nbsp;* (Proc section 6.7 Non-Existent Memory Errors): - If the high 4 bits of
  the PA are one bits, the lower 18 bits are used for a UNIBUS address.  Thus
  accessing PA 17777374 is mapped to a read of UNIBUS address 777374.</p>
  &nbsp;* (Proc section 6.7): If after 10 to 20 uSec there is no response, the CPU
  does a UNIBUS Time Out abort and bit 4 in the CPU Error Register is set.</p>
  <p>
  (Proc Appendix B): The CPU Error Register is at PA 17777766.  Examining that
  register confirms the UNIBUS Time Out.  This is reasonable.  (Prog) and
  (Proc Appendix B) show the RK11 registers are at UNIBUS addresses 777400 through
  777416.  The Simp configuration printout shows no devices using 777374.</p>
  <table cellpadding=5><caption><em>Examine the CPU Error Register</em></caption><td><pre>

  Crash definitely occurred in the DKDRV.  Looking at the source code to get
  more insight.  Task Builder map of DKDRV.TSK shows there is only one PSECT
  called ". BLK.".  There is only one source module, DKDRV, that supplied all
  the contents of that PSECT.  Addresses in that PSECT have been relocated to

  Examination of source of DKDRV lets us confirm the manual code disassembly
  used earlier in the analysis.  (Add 120000 to addresses in this listing to
  get the virtual address where the code will be at runtime.)
  This shows intent of the code -- this
  is important because we see the value in R2 gets modified.  At line
  239 R2 should contain the CSR address of the RK11 controller.</p>

  CSR address is loaded into R2 by line 228.  R2 is modified but when the trap
  occured during instruction on line 239, R2 again should contain the CSR address.
  R2 contained 177400; the correct CSR addr is 177404.  If R2 contained
  177404 the trap would not have occurred.</p>
  <p>
  The wrong CSR address is due to an error made during the prepgen.  The
  default address provided by SYSGEN.CMD should not have been changed.<br />
  &nbsp;Similarly, the TC11 DECtape controller CSR address should not
  override the default from SYSGEN.</p>

  <h2>Correcting the Problem</h2>
  <p>
  These problems can be fixed by editing LB:[200,200]SYSSAVED.CMD and removing
  the explicit CSR addresses for the DK and DT devices.  Then SYSGEN Phases 1
  and 2 can be re-run.  This is what was already demonstrated during the
  <a href="RSXM32_Redux.html#sysSavedFix2">most recent SYSGEN</a>.  SYSGEN Phase
  3 and what followed in that web page do not need to be done again.</p>
